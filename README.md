# InsightUBC
The goal of this project is to provide a way to perform some of the tasks required to run the university and to enable effective querying of the metadata from around campus. This involves working with courses, prerequisites, past course averages, room scheduling, and timetable creation.

This is a full stack web development project split into four sprints. The first three sprints are server-side development using Node.js. The fourth sprint is client-side development.

Development was done with TypeScript and packages that are mocha, chai and fs-extra
